# Explain Activity in Android

### ðŸ“Œ **Activities in Android**  

An **Activity** in Android represents a single screen with a user interface. It is one of the fundamental building blocks of an Android app and acts as an entry point for user interactions.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Key Characteristics of an Activity**  
1. **Represents a UI Screen:** Every Activity corresponds to a screen in the app.  
2. **Lifecycle Management:** Activities have a well-defined lifecycle managed by the Android system.  
3. **Navigation & Interaction:** Activities facilitate user navigation and interaction with the app.  
4. **Back Stack Management:** Android manages the Activity back stack to handle user navigation.

## ðŸ”¹ **Activity Lifecycle**  
The Android system manages Activities through a lifecycle with various states:  

### ðŸ“Œ **Activity States:**  
1. **Created** â†’ When the Activity is first created.  
2. **Started** â†’ Visible but not in the foreground.  
3. **Resumed** â†’ The Activity is in the foreground and interacts with the user.  
4. **Paused** â†’ Partially visible but not focused.  
5. **Stopped** â†’ No longer visible but still in memory.  
6. **Destroyed** â†’ The Activity is removed from memory.  

### ðŸ”„ **Lifecycle Callbacks:**  
- `onCreate()` â†’ Called when the Activity is created.  
- `onStart()` â†’ Called when the Activity becomes visible.  
- `onResume()` â†’ Called when the Activity comes to the foreground.  
- `onPause()` â†’ Called when another Activity comes in front.  
- `onStop()` â†’ Called when the Activity is no longer visible.  
- `onDestroy()` â†’ Called before the Activity is destroyed.

## ðŸ”¹ **Declaring an Activity**  
In `AndroidManifest.xml`, every Activity must be declared:  
```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity" />
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Starting a New Activity**  
To open a new Activity, use an **Intent**:  
```kotlin
val intent = Intent(this, SecondActivity::class.java)
startActivity(intent)
```

To pass data between Activities:  
```kotlin
intent.putExtra("KEY", "Value")
startActivity(intent)
```
Retrieve the data in the second Activity:  
```kotlin
val data = intent.getStringExtra("KEY")
```

## ðŸ”¹ **Types of Activities in Android**  
1. **MainActivity** â†’ The first screen when an app launches.  
2. **Transparent Activity** â†’ Uses a transparent theme for overlays.  
3. **Dialog Activity** â†’ Shows an Activity as a dialog.  
4. **Fullscreen Activity** â†’ Hides system bars for immersive mode.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Best Practices for Activities**  
âœ” Use **Fragments** for better UI flexibility instead of multiple Activities.  
âœ” Avoid **keeping large objects** in Activity memory.  
âœ” Use **ViewModels** to persist UI state across configuration changes.  
âœ” Follow the **Single Activity Architecture** where possible with Navigation Component.

### ðŸš€ **Conclusion**  
Activities are an essential part of Android apps, handling user interactions and navigation. Managing their lifecycle properly ensures a smooth user experience and optimized app performance.
